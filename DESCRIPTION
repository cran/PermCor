Description: 
    Provides tools for statistical testing of correlation coefficients through robust 
    permutation method and large sample approximation method. Tailored to different types 
    of correlation coefficients including Pearson correlation coefficient, weighted 
    Pearson correlation coefficient, Spearman correlation coefficient, and Lin's 
    concordance correlation coefficient.The robust permutation test controls type I error
    under general scenarios when sample size is small and two variables are dependent but 
    uncorrelated. The large sample approximation test generally controls type I error when
    the sample size is large (>200).
